            Mukesh Ambani
        </h1>
        <p>Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (born 19 April 1957) is
            an Indian billionaire business magnate, and the
            chairman, managing director, and largest
            shareholder of Reliance Industries Ltd.
            (RIL), a Fortune Global 500 company and
            India's most valuable company by market value.
            He is currently the richest man in Asia.</p>
        <h3>Early life:</h3>
        <p>
            Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani was born on 19 April
            1957 in the British Crown colony of Aden
            (in present-day Yemen) to Dhirubhai Ambani
            and Kokilaben Ambani. He has a younger brother
            Anil Ambani and two sisters, Nina Bhadrashyam
            Kothari and Dipti Dattaraj Salgaocar.

            Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen because his
            father decided to move back to India in 1958
            to start a trading business that focused on
            spices and textiles. The latter was originally
            named "Vimal" but later changed to "Only Vimal.
            "His family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment
            in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai until the 1970s.
            The family's financial status slightly improved
            when they moved to India but Ambani still lived
            in a communal society, used public transportation,
            and never received an allowance.Dhirubhai later
            purchased a 14-floor apartment block called 'Sea Wind'
            in Colaba, where, until recently, Ambani and his brother
            lived with their families on different floors.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Education:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ambani attended the Hill Grange High School at Peddar Road,
            Mumbai, along with his brother and Anand Jain, who later
            became his close associate. After his secondary schooling,
            he studied at the St. Xavier's College, Mumbai.
            He then received a BE degree in Chemical Engineering
            from the Institute of Chemical Technology.

            Ambani later enrolled for an MBA at Stanford University
            but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance,
            which at the time was still a small but fast-growing
            enterprise. His father felt that real-life skills were
            harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a
            classroom, so he called his son back to India from Stanford
            to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.

            Ambani has been quoted as saying that he was influenced by his
            teachers William F. Sharpe and Man Mohan Sharma because they are
            "the kind of professors who made you think out of the box."
        </p>
        <h3>
            Career:
        </h3>
        <p>
            In 1981 he started to help his father Dhirubhai Ambani run their
            family business, Reliance Industries Limited. By this time, it
            had already expanded so that it also dealt in refining and petrochemicals.
            The business also included products and services in retail and
            telecommunications industries. Reliance Retail Ltd., another
            subsidiary, is also the largest retailer in India.[18] Reliance's
            Jio has earned a top-five spot in the country's telecommunication services
            since its public launch on 5 September 2016.

            As of 2016, Ambani was ranked 38 and has consistently held the
            title of India's richest person on Forbes magazine's list for
            the past ten years. He is the only Indian businessman on Forbes'
            list of the world's most powerful people. As of January 2018,
            Mukesh Ambani was ranked by Forbes as the 18th-wealthiest person in
            the world. He surpassed Jack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group,
            to become Asia's richest person with a net worth of $44.3 billion in
            July 2018. He is also the wealthiest person in the world outside North
            America and Europe. As of 2015, Ambani ranked fifth among India's
            philanthropists, according to China's Hurun Research Institute. He
            was appointed as a Director of Bank of America and became the first
            non-American to be on its board.

            Through Reliance, he also owns the Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai
            Indians and is the founder of Indian Super League, a football league in India.
            In 2012, Forbes named him one of the richest sports owners in the world.
            He resides at the Antilia Building, one of the world's most expensive private
            residences with its value reaching $1 billion

        <h3>
            Timeline:
        </h3>
        <p>
            1980s – 1990s
            In 1980, the Indian government under Indira Gandhi
            opened PFY (polyester filament yarn) manufacturing to the private sector.
            Dhirubhai Ambani applied for a license to set up a PFY manufacturing plant.
            Obtaining the license was a long-drawn-out process requiring a strong connection
            within the bureaucracy system because the government, at the time, was restricting
            large-scale manufacturing, making the importation of yarn for the textiles
            impossible. In spite of stiff competition from Tatas, Birlas and 43 others,
            Dhirubhai was awarded the license, more commonly addressed as License Raj.
            To help him build the PFY plant, Dhirubhai pulled his eldest son out of Stanford,
            where he was studying for his MBA, to work with him in the company. Ambani
            did not return to his university program, leading Reliance's backward integration,
            where companies own their suppliers to generate more revenue and improve efficiency,
            in 1981 from textiles into polyester fibers and further into petrochemicals,
            which the yarns were made from. After joining the company, he reported daily
            to Rasikbhai Meswani, then executive director. The company was being built from
            scratch with the principle of everybody contributing to the business and not
            heavily depend on selected individuals. Dhirubhai treated him as a business partner
            allowing him the freedom to contribute even with little experience.
            This principle came into play after Rasikbhai's death in 1985 along with
            Dhirubhai suffering a stroke in 1986 when all the responsibility shifted to
            Ambani and his brother.[30] Mukesh Ambani set up Reliance Infocomm Limited
            (now Reliance Communications Limited), which was focused on information and
            communications technology initiatives.[31] At the age of 24, Ambani was given
            charge of the construction of Patalganga petrochemical plant when the company
            was heavily investing in oil refinery and petrochemicals.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2000s – Present:

        </h3>
        <p>
            On 6 July 2002, Mukesh's father died after suffering a second stroke,
            which elevated tensions between the brothers as Dhirubhai had not left
            a will for the distribution of the empire in 2004.
            Their mother intervened to stop the feud, splitting the company into two,
            Ambani receiving control of Reliance Industries Limited and Indian
            Petrochemicals Corporation Limited, which was later approved by the Bombay
            High Court in December 2005.

            Ambani directed and led the creation of the world's largest grassroots
            petroleum refinery at Jamnagar, India, which had the capacity to
            produce 660,000 barrels per day (33 million tonnes per year) in 2010,
            integrated with petrochemicals, power generation, port, and related
            infrastructure.[37] In December 2013 Ambani announced, at the Progressive
            Punjab Summit in Mohali, the possibility of a "collaborative venture"
            with Bharti Airtel in setting up digital infrastructure for the 4G network
            in India. On 18 June 2014, Mukesh Ambani, while addressing the 40th AGM
            of Reliance Industries, said he will invest Rs 1.8 trillion (short scale)
            across businesses in the next three years and launch 4G broadband services in
            2015. In February 2016, Ambani-led Jio launched its own 4G smartphone brand named LYF
            .[40] In June 2016, it was India's third-largest-selling mobile phone brand.
            The release of the service Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, commonly known as Jio,
            in September 2016 was a success, and Reliance's shares increased.
            During the 40th annual general meeting of RIL, he announced bonus shares in the
            ratio of 1:1 which is the country's largest bonus issue in India, and announced
            the Jio Phone at an effective price of ₹0.[43] As of February 2018, Bloomberg's
            "Robin Hood Index" estimated that Ambani's personal wealth was enough to fund the
            operations of the Indian federal government for 20 days.

            In February 2014, a First Information Report (FIR) alleging criminal offenses
            was filed against Mukesh Ambani for alleged irregularities in the pricing of
            natural gas from the KG basin.[45] Arvind Kejriwal, who had a short stint as
            Delhi's chief minister and had ordered the FIR, has accused various political
            parties of being silent on the gas price issue.[46] Kejriwal has asked both
            Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi to clear their stand on the gas pricing issue.
            Kejriwal has alleged that the Centre allowed the price of gas to be inflated
            to eight dollars a unit though Mukesh Ambani's company spends only one dollar
            to produce a unit, which meant a loss of Rs. 540 billion to the country annually.

        <h3>
            Personal life:
        </h3>
        <p>
            He married Nita Ambani in 1985 and they have two sons; Anant and Akash,
 and a daughter, Isha.They met after his father attended a dance 
performance which Nita took part in and thought of the idea of arranging 
a marriage between the two.

They live in Antilia, a private 27-storey building in Mumbai,
 which was valued at US$1 billion and was the most expensive 
private residence in the world at the time it was built. The building
 requires a staff of 600 for maintenance, and it includes three helipads
, a 160-car garage, private movie theater, swimming pool, and fitness center.

In 2007, Ambani gifted his wife a $60 million Airbus A319 for her 44th birthday.
 The airbus, which has a capacity of 180 passengers, has been custom-fitted to 
include a living room, bedroom, satellite television, WiFi, sky bar, Jacuzzi,
 and an office.

Ambani was titled "The World's Richest Sports Team Owner" after his purchase of
 the IPL cricket team Mumbai Indians for $111.9 million in 2008.

In an interview with Rajdeep Sardesai in March 2017, he said that his favourite 
food continued to be idli sambar and his favourite restaurant remains Mysore Café, 
a restaurant in Kings circle (Mumbai) where he used to eat as a student at UDCT. 
Mukesh Ambani is a strict vegetarian and teetotaler. He is a very big fan of 
Bollywood movies, watching three a week because he says "you need some amount of
 escapism in life."
During the fiscal year ending 31 March 2012, he reportedly decided to forgo nearly 
₹240 million from his annual pay as chief of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). 
He elected to do this even as RIL's total remuneration packages to its top management
 personnel increased during that fiscal year. Mukesh Ambani holds a 44.7% stake in the
 company. This move kept his salary capped at ₹150  million for the fourth year in a row.

In early 2019, a court in Mumbai held his younger brother, Anil Ambani, in criminal 
contempt for non-payment of personally guaranteed debt Reliance Communications owed to
 Swedish gearmaker Ericsson. Instead of jail time, the court gave Anil a month to come up
 with the funds. At the end of the month, Mukesh bailed out his younger brother.
